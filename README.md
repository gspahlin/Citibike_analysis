Analysis of data from citibike using Python and Tableau

This repo contains an analysis I did of how people are using the Citibike bicycle rental service in the Jersey City area. It contains a Jupyter Notebook that I used
to clean, filter and process data, a Tableau notebook containing charts and findings, and a report summarizing my thinking about the data.
