# Citibike_analysis
Analysis of data from citibike using Python and Tableau

This repo contains an analysis I did of how people are using the Citibike bicycle rental service in the Jersey City area. It contains a Jupyter Notebook that I used
to clean, filter and process data, a Tableau notebook containing charts and findings, and a report summarizing my thinking about the data.

Report.docx - A short report on the behavior of Newark, NJ citibike riders and their behavior. 

citibike_dataset_creation.ipynb - This notebook was used to concatenate the data from several .csv files into one dataset. I also used this to implement the Haversine
formula, to calculate the displacement of the bike travelers based on longitude and latitude of starting and ending coordinates.
